 ReUtilyze is a portal for electronic equipment recycling program that gives provision for user to earn reward points against their old or waste electronic equipment’s.

The rise of carbon footprint over the past few years has impacted the environment adversely. Hoarding of e-waste in the form of old devices lead to stagnation of reusability and increased production of the raw materials to create new electronic goods. When electronics are not disposed appropriately, they end up in landfills. Toxic chemicals are released, impacting the earth's air, soil, water and ultimately, human health. Reducing individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesn’t happen overnight! It happens by making small changes to our actions.

ReUtilyze is built on the platform that will reward the individual with points for giving up old device which can be used to purchase new products in return as well provide a platform to get rid of the device that is obsolete.
